It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species in the genus \\'\\'[[Orcinus]]\\'\\'. Orcas are recognizable by their black-and-white patterned body. A [[cosmopolitan species]], they are found in diverse marine environments, from [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] to [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic regions]] to tropical seas.\\n\\nOrcas are [[apex predator]]s with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. This includes a variety of [[fish]], [[shark]]s, [[Batoids|rays]], and [[marine mammal]]s such as [[Pinniped|seals]] and other [[Cetacea|dolphins and whales]]. They are highly [[Social animal|social]]; some populations are composed of highly stable [[matrilineal]] family groups (pods). Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, often specific to a particular group and passed along from generation to generation, are considered to be manifestations of [[animal culture]].\\n\\nThe [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] assesses the orca\\'s [[conservation status]] as [[data deficient]] because of the likelihood that two or more orca types are [[Species problem|separate species]]. Some local populations are considered [[Threatened species|threatened]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to prey depletion, [[habitat loss]], pollution (by [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]), capture for [[marine mammal park]]s, and [[Commercial fishing#Environmental Risk|conflicts with human fisheries]]. In late 2005, the [[southern resident killer whale|southern resident orca]]s were placed on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species of mammals and birds|U.S. Endangered Species list]].\\n\\nOrcas are not usually a threat to humans, and no fatal attack has ever been documented in their natural habitat. There have been cases of [[Killer whale attacks on humans#Captive orca attacks|captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers]] at marine theme parks. Orcas also feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, and their reputation in different cultures ranges from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.\\n\\n==Naming==\\nOrcas are commonly referred to as \"killer whales\", despite being a type of dolphin.<ref name=\"whales.org\">{{cite web |title=Facts about orcas (killer whales) |url=https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-orcas/ |website=Whales.org |publisher=Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA |access-date=8 February 2022 |archive-date=February 8, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220208153903/https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-orcas/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the 1960s, the use of \"orca\" instead of \"killer whale\" has steadily grown in common use.<ref name=\"price\">{{cite web|first=Mary |last=Price|url=https://blog.nwf.org/2013/07/orcas-how-science-debunked-superstition/|title=Orcas: How Science Debunked Superstition|publisher=National Wildlife Federation|date=22 July 2013|access-date=30 July 2020|archive-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131095114/http://blog.nwf.org/2013/07/orcas-how-science-debunked-superstition/|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nThe genus name \\'\\'Orcinus\\'\\' means \"of the kingdom of the dead\",{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=69}} or \"belonging to [[Orcus]]\".<ref>[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/killer-whale/scientific-classification.htm Killer Whales.

However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for orcas, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.<ref name=\"EMM2009\">{{cite book|last=Estes|first=James|editor=Perrin, William F.|others=Wursig, Bernd & Thewissen, J.

[[Spyhopping]] is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings.{{sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=64}} Resident orcas swim alongside [[porpoise]]s and other [[dolphin]]s.<ref name=\"OCR 11-2019\">{{cite news |last=Connelly |first=Laylan |title=Videos show killer whales frantically hunting for dolphins off San Clemente |publisher=[[Orange County Register|The OCR]] |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/07/30/videos-show-killer-whales-in-a-frantic-hunt-for-dolphins-off-san-clemente/ |date=July 30, 2019 |access-date=November 24, 2019 |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210204422/https://www.ocregister.com/2019/07/30/videos-show-killer-whales-in-a-frantic-hunt-for-dolphins-off-san-clemente/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nOrcas will engage in [[surplus killing]], that is, killing that is not designed to be for food.

Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on [[matriline]]s consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, an orca named [[Luna (orca)|Luna]], no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}}\\n\\n[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|A pair of orcas in the [[Pacific Northwest]]]]\\nClosely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} [[DNA]] testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39}} Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12}} The highest association layer is the community, which consists of pods that regularly associate with each other but share no maternal relations or dialects.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1= J.

Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become \"rovers\" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=13}} As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14}}\\n\\nAs with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating orcas off Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating orcas in Argentina and the [[Crozet Islands]] behave more like transients.{{sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=27}}\\n\\nOrcas of the same sex and age group may engage in physical contact and synchronous surfacing.

The whales seemed \"agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water\" to escape the sound of the sonars.<ref name = Pickrell/> \"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar.

Air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome P450 1A gene family.<ref name=\"Lachmuth et al. 2011\"/> Researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales. A direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene. Vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems, with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility. A modelling study determined that the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of exhaust pollutants was about 12% of the human dose.<ref name=\"Lachmuth et al. 2011\"/>\\n\\nAs a response to this, in 2017 boats off the British Columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres. This new rule complements Washington State\\'s minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011. If a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes.

From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44}}\\n\\nOrganizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.{{efn|Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.}} That said, a 2015 study coauthored by staff at [[SeaWorld]] and the [[Minnesota Zoo]] suggested no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive orcas.<ref name=robeck/> However, in the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rose|first1= N.
