    "## What is machine learning?\n",
    "(This chapter borrows heavily from Chapter 16 of Bagrow & Ahn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning, in the broadest sense, refers to building models that can predict things; we build these models using a bunch of math and a lot of data. In Class 14 and Class 15, we'll be going over \"regular\" (i.e. non-network ML) and \"network\" (i.e. ML on graphs) techniques, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point (2024), machine learning algorithms are pretty ubiquitous. Computing, including GPU computing, is cheap enough that even mildly successful ML algorithms can make a significant difference in a company's revenue compared to baseline (although the idea that there is an ML-free baseline is increasingly laughable). You may have noticed ML at work when you get uncannily targeted ads on social media (or worse, weirdly damning ones -- why, oh why, does Facebook think I need this giant acrylic crab table?). \n",
    "\n",
    "![crab ad 1](images/crab_ad.jpeg)\n",
    "![crab ad 2](images/crab_ad_2.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also see ML in face/fingerprint ID technology on your phones, text prediction in any application where you produce text, and Microsoft Excel trying to parse everything as a date (or worse, extrapolate from your data).\n",

    "### Unsupervised vs. Supervised ML\n",
    "Let's break down some of the common tasks ML can do. The first division we'll introduce will be **supervised** versus **unsupervised** machine learning. With **supervised** ML, we have a bunch of data points and the ground truth corresponding to each of them. For example, I might have a bunch of data on students' academic work as well as their final grades. Or I might have data on customers' browsing behavior along with information on what they bought/didn't buy. In **unsupervised** machine learning, I don't have that ground truth \"answer\" available, or I choose not to use it. Instead, I use a different set of algorithms to find patterns or commonalities within the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised ML Problems\n",
    "### Regression vs. Classification\n",
    "Regression refers to the task of predicting a continuous/numeric output, while classification means we're predicting a discrete output. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we do machine learning for either case, we often want to think about a **loss function**, which is a measure of how well our model fits the data we're using to train it. Loss functions are usually differentiable such that you can figure out algorithmic ways to minimize them given training data, but some are messier to deal with than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen a linear regression before - given a bunch of data points **X** and a set of dependent variables **y**, we want to find the best vector **$\\beta$** for **X** and **y** such that $\\beta X + \\epsilon  y$, where **$\\epsilon$** is a random error term. Formally, the loss function for such a regression, if we're using mean squared error loss, is $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N}(y_i - (\\beta x_i + \\epsilon))^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also run a **logistic regression**, which works well for classification tasks. Logistic regressions are very similar to linear regressions, but instead of fitting to some dependent variable $y$ as a linear combination of its independent variables $X$, we model the **log-odds** of some event as the linear combination of independent variables. The log-odds (or \"logit\") of an event with probability $p$ is defined as $\\log\\frac{p}{1-p}$. This function neatly maps probabilities, which range from 0 to 1, onto the whole range of real numbers. It is also the inverse of the **sigmoid** function, which is defined as $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$. For each data point, we relate the log-odds to a linear regression problem once again:\n",
    "$$\\log\\frac{p}{1-p} = \\beta x_i + \\epsilon$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the model's calculated probability for a data point $x_i$, using $\\beta$ as our coefficient vector once again, to be \n",
    "$$\\hat{p}(x_i) = \\frac{e^{\\beta x_i}}{1 + b^{\\beta x_i}}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use a log-likelihood or cross-entropy loss. The cross-entropy between two distributions $p$ and $q$ is defined as \n",
    "$$H(p, q) = p(x) \\log q(x)$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-entropy is useful for quantifying how much two distributions diverge, or how \"surprising\" an estimate $q(x_i)$ is for a given \"ground truth\" value of $p$. The cross-entropy loss (or log-likelihood) of our model's calculated probabilities will be\n",
    " \n",
    "$$ l = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\log\\hat{p}(x_i) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (1 - y_i)\\log(1-\\hat{p}(x_i))$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try loading two datasets, one for classification and one for regression, and trying out logistic and linear regression with `scikit-learn` in Python."
